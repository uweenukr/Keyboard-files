Use these files for flashing your Zen 2

#To download the hex files:
1. Doanload the entire repo
2. Download individual files
   1. Click on the hex/eep file link
   2. Right-click on the "RAW" Button
   3. Select "Save link as..."

Keep in mind that the slave (default right) side must have RGB disabled, and to change the keymap you only need to flash the master (default left).
